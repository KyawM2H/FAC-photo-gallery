            the Maldives is sprinkled with some of the most beautiful beaches in
            the world. But an experienced visitor knows that the best of them do
            not have clear borderline (not permanent). Sand moves around the
            coral islands in seasons, and at the moment when someone interferes
            with this natural process with walls and breakwaters or pumping
            sand, this picturesque perfection and quality underfoot, depreciates
            with sometimes being able to the biolumiesecent bacteria on the
            shore to ilumiate the shores.</span

            There’s no missing this North Devon beach, one of Britain’s best, as
            this five-star 3-mile long beach is the ultimate destination for a
            UK beach holiday. Woolacombe beach lies between Baggy Point and
            Morte Point, to the north of Putsborough Sands, and the town itself
            has a laid back atmosphere and is wonderfully family friendly.

            Whitehaven Beach in the Whitsunday Islands along the Great Barrier
            Reef is not just one of Australia's top stretches of coast, it often
            scores a place on lists of the best beaches in the world. The
            seven-kilometer arc of powdery white sand here is actually silica, a
            silky-soft substance that creates a striking contrast with the
            tropical turquoise sea and emerald headlands. Best of all, the beach
            lies in a national park on Whitsunday Island, ensuring that it
            remains protected and pristine, despite the many day-trippers who
            land on these shores.</span

          ><span class="desc-more-5">
            For an epic adventure, it’s possible to combine three favourite
            trekking regions into one trek. The route from Rara Lake to Jomsom
            via Upper Dolpo requires a lot of time, stamina and fitness, and
            it’s necessary to camp most of the way. There are several 5000
            metre-plus passes to cross on this trek, so your fitness and
            trekking experience levels should be very high. But, it is very
            rewarding for experienced trekkers.</span

          AROUND LOWER MUSTANG <span class="dots-6"></span
          ><span class="desc-more-6">
            Using Jomsom, Kagbeni and/or Marpha as a base from which to explore
            Lower Mustang is a great alternative to a multi-day trek in Lower
            Mustang. It is still possible to do a number of invigorating day
            hikes while retreating to more comfortable accommodation in the
            evenings; this option is ideal for travellers short on time, those
            who are not confident doing multi-day treks, or those with children.
            The hike between Jomsom and Kagbeni, up the Kali Gandaki Gorge,
            takes a few hours, as does the steep uphill trek (along the road)
            from Kagbeni to Muktinath. From Kagbeni there are a number of walks
            to monasteries and meditation caves. Lubra is another good
            destination from Kagbeni, as it is one of the few places where the
            pre-Buddhist Bon religion is still practised.</span

          ROLWALING AND TASHI LAPCHA PASS TREK

          ><span class="desc-more-7">
            The Rolwaling trek with the Tashi Lapcha Pass is a very challenging trek that should only be attempted by experienced trekkers, due to the extremely high Tashi Lapcha Pass (5,750 metres) that must be crossed. Mountaineering experience is recommended.

            was one of the worst-hit areas in the earthquakes of 2015. The small
            village of Lantang was completely wiped out by a landslide. The
            surviving people of the Langtang Valley are doing their best to
            rebuild their lives and livelihoods, and tourists are being welcomed
            back to this area and helping it thrive once more. While evidence of
            the damage can be seen, there are plenty of places to stay, and the
            landscape is as beautiful as it was before the natural
            disaster.</span
